inputs:
  description: |
    A collection of arguments for invoking getClusterCredentials.
  properties:
    autoCreate:
      type: boolean
      description: |
        Create a database user with the name specified for the user named in `db_user` if one does not exist.
    clusterIdentifier:
      type: string
      description: |
        Unique identifier of the cluster that contains the database for which your are requesting credentials.
    dbGroups:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      description: |
        List of the names of existing database groups that the user named in `db_user` will join for the current session, in addition to any group memberships for an existing user. If not specified, a new user is added only to `PUBLIC`.
    dbName:
      type: string
      description: |
        Name of a database that DbUser is authorized to log on to. If `db_name` is not specified, `db_user` can log on to any existing database.
    dbUser:
      type: string
      description: |
        Name of a database user. If a user name matching `db_user` exists in the database, the temporary user credentials have the same permissions as the  existing user. If `db_user` doesn't exist in the database and `auto_create` is `True`, a new user is created using the value for `db_user` with `PUBLIC` permissions.  If a database user matching the value for `db_user` doesn't exist and `not` is `False`, then the command succeeds but the connection attempt will fail because the user doesn't exist in the database.
    durationSeconds:
      type: integer
      description: |
        The number of seconds until the returned temporary password expires. Valid values are between `900` and `3600`. Default value is `900`.
