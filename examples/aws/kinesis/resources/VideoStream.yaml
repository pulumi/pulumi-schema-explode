      A time stamp that indicates when the stream was created.
  dataRetentionInHours:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The number of hours that you want to retain the data in the stream. Kinesis Video Streams retains the data in a data store that is associated with the stream. The default value is `0`, indicating that the stream does not persist data.
  deviceName:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the device that is writing to the stream. **In the current implementation, Kinesis Video Streams does not use this name.**
  kmsKeyId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The ID of the AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) key that you want Kinesis Video Streams to use to encrypt stream data. If no key ID is specified, the default, Kinesis Video-managed key (`aws/kinesisvideo`) is used.
  mediaType:
    type: string
    description: |
      The media type of the stream. Consumers of the stream can use this information when processing the stream.
