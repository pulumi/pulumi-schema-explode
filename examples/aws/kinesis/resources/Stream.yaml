properties:
  arn:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) specifying the Stream (same as `id`)
  encryptionType:
    type: string
    description: |
      The encryption type to use. The only acceptable values are `NONE` or `KMS`. The default value is `NONE`.
  enforceConsumerDeletion:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      A boolean that indicates all registered consumers should be deregistered from the stream so that the stream can be destroyed without error. The default value is `false`.
  kmsKeyId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The GUID for the customer-managed KMS key to use for encryption. You can also use a Kinesis-owned master key by specifying the alias `alias/aws/kinesis`.
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      A name to identify the stream. This is unique to the AWS account and region the Stream is created in.
  retentionPeriod:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Length of time data records are accessible after they are added to the stream. The maximum value of a stream's retention period is 8760 hours. Minimum value is 24. Default is 24.
  shardCount:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The number of shards that the stream will use. If the `stream_mode` is `PROVISIONED`, this field is required.
      Amazon has guidelines for specifying the Stream size that should be referenced when creating a Kinesis stream. See [Amazon Kinesis Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kinesis/latest/dev/amazon-kinesis-streams.html) for more.
  shardLevelMetrics:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      A list of shard-level CloudWatch metrics which can be enabled for the stream. See [Monitoring with CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/monitoring-with-cloudwatch.html) for more. Note that the value ALL should not be used; instead you should provide an explicit list of metrics you wish to enable.
  streamModeDetails:
    $ref: "#/types/aws:kinesis/StreamStreamModeDetails:StreamStreamModeDetails"
    description: |
      Indicates the [capacity mode](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/how-do-i-size-a-stream.html) of the data stream. Detailed below.
  tags:

    additionalProperties:
      type: string

    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
