    description: |
      ID for a GovCloud account created with the account.
  iamUserAccessToBilling:
    type: string
    description: |
      If set to `ALLOW`, the new account enables IAM users and roles to access account billing information if they have the required permissions. If set to `DENY`, then only the root user (and no roles) of the new account can access account billing information. If this is unset, the AWS API will default this to `ALLOW`. If the resource is created and this option is changed, it will try to recreate the account.

  parentId:

      Parent Organizational Unit ID or Root ID for the account. Defaults to the Organization default Root ID. A configuration must be present for this argument to perform drift detection.
  roleName:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of an IAM role that Organizations automatically preconfigures in the new member account. This role trusts the root account, allowing users in the root account to assume the role, as permitted by the root account administrator. The role has administrator permissions in the new member account. The Organizations API provides no method for reading this information after account creation, so the provider cannot perform drift detection on its value and will always show a difference for a configured value after import unless `ignoreChanges` is used.
