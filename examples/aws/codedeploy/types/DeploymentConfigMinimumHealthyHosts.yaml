      The value when the type is `FLEET_PERCENT` represents the minimum number of healthy instances as
      a percentage of the total number of instances in the deployment. If you specify FLEET_PERCENT, at the start of the
      deployment, AWS CodeDeploy converts the percentage to the equivalent number of instance and rounds up fractional instances.
      When the type is `HOST_COUNT`, the value represents the minimum number of healthy instances as an absolute value.
