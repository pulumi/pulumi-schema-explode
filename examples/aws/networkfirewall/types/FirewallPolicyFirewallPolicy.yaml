      Set of actions to take on a packet if it does not match any stateful rules in the policy. This can only be specified if the policy has a `stateful_engine_options` block with a `rule_order` value of `STRICT_ORDER`. You can specify one of either or neither values of `aws:drop_strict` or `aws:drop_established`, as well as any combination of `aws:alert_strict` and `aws:alert_established`.

      Set of actions to take on a packet if it does not match any of the stateless rules in the policy. You must specify one of the standard actions including: `aws:drop`, `aws:pass`, or `aws:forward_to_sfe`.
      In addition, you can specify custom actions that are compatible with your standard action choice. If you want non-matching packets to be forwarded for stateful inspection, specify `aws:forward_to_sfe`.
