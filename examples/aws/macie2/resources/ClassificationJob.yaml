      The status for the job. Valid values are: `CANCELLED`, `RUNNING` and `USER_PAUSED`
  jobType:
    type: string
    description: |
      The schedule for running the job. Valid values are: `ONE_TIME` - Run the job only once. If you specify this value, don't specify a value for the `schedule_frequency` property. `SCHEDULED` - Run the job on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. If you specify this value, use the `schedule_frequency` property to define the recurrence pattern for the job.

  samplingPercentage:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The sampling depth, as a percentage, to apply when processing objects. This value determines the percentage of eligible objects that the job analyzes. If this value is less than 100, Amazon Macie selects the objects to analyze at random, up to the specified percentage, and analyzes all the data in those objects.
