  digestAlgorithmMnemonic:
    type: string
    description: |
      A string used to represent the delegation signer digest algorithm. This value must follow the guidelines provided by [RFC-8624 Section 3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8624#section-3.3).
  digestAlgorithmType:
    type: integer
    description: |
      An integer used to represent the delegation signer digest algorithm. This value must follow the guidelines provided by [RFC-8624 Section 3.3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8624#section-3.3).
  digestValue:
    type: string
    description: |
      A cryptographic digest of a DNSKEY resource record (RR). DNSKEY records are used to publish the public key that resolvers can use to verify DNSSEC signatures that are used to secure certain kinds of information provided by the DNS system.
  dnskeyRecord:
    type: string
    description: |
      A string that represents a DNSKEY record.
  dsRecord:
    type: string
    description: |
      A string that represents a delegation signer (DS) record.
  flag:
    type: integer
    description: |
      An integer that specifies how the key is used. For key-signing key (KSK), this value is always 257.
  hostedZoneId:
    type: string
    description: |
      Identifier of the Route 53 Hosted Zone.
  keyManagementServiceArn:
    type: string
    description: |
      Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Key Management Service (KMS) Key. This must be unique for each key-signing key (KSK) in a single hosted zone. This key must be in the `us-east-1` Region and meet certain requirements, which are described in the [Route 53 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/dns-configuring-dnssec-cmk-requirements.html) and [Route 53 API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKeySigningKey.html).
  keyTag:
    type: integer
    description: |
      An integer used to identify the DNSSEC record for the domain name. The process used to calculate the value is described in [RFC-4034 Appendix B](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4034.txt).

    type: string
    description: |
      The public key, represented as a Base64 encoding, as required by [RFC-4034 Page 5](https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4034.txt).
  signingAlgorithmMnemonic:
    type: string
