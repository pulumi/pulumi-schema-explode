      A custom description of the custom data identifier. The description can contain as many as 512 characters.
  ignoreWords:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      An array that lists specific character sequences (ignore words) to exclude from the results. If the text matched by the regular expression is the same as any string in this array, Amazon Macie ignores it. The array can contain as many as 10 ignore words. Each ignore word can contain 4 - 90 characters. Ignore words are case sensitive.
  keywords:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      An array that lists specific character sequences (keywords), one of which must be within proximity (`maximum_match_distance`) of the regular expression to match. The array can contain as many as 50 keywords. Each keyword can contain 3 - 90 characters. Keywords aren't case sensitive.
  maximumMatchDistance:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The maximum number of characters that can exist between text that matches the regex pattern and the character sequences specified by the keywords array. Macie includes or excludes a result based on the proximity of a keyword to text that matches the regex pattern. The distance can be 1 - 300 characters. The default value is 50.
  name:
    type: string
  namePrefix:
    type: string
