  encrypted:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Boolean controlling whether the created EBS volumes will be encrypted. Can't be used with `snapshot_id`.

  snapshotId:
    type: string
    description: |
      ID of an EBS snapshot that will be used to initialize the created
      EBS volumes. If set, the `volume_size` attribute must be at least as large as the referenced

  volumeSize:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Size of created volumes in GiB.
      If `snapshot_id` is set and `volume_size` is omitted then the volume will have the same size
