properties:
  arn:
    type: string
    description: |
      The ARN of the traffic mirror session.
  description:
    type: string
    description: |
      A description of the traffic mirror session.
  networkInterfaceId:
    type: string
    description: |
      ID of the source network interface. Not all network interfaces are eligible as mirror sources. On EC2 instances only nitro based instances support mirroring.
  ownerId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The AWS account ID of the session owner.
  packetLength:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The number of bytes in each packet to mirror. These are bytes after the VXLAN header. Do not specify this parameter when you want to mirror the entire packet. To mirror a subset of the packet, set this to the length (in bytes) that you want to mirror.
  sessionNumber:
    type: integer
    description: |
      - The session number determines the order in which sessions are evaluated when an interface is used by multiple sessions. The first session with a matching filter is the one that mirrors the packets.
  tags:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
  tagsAll:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
  trafficMirrorFilterId:
    type: string
    description: |
      ID of the traffic mirror filter to be used
  trafficMirrorTargetId:
    type: string
    description: |
      ID of the traffic mirror target to be used
  virtualNetworkId:
    type: integer
    description: |
      - The VXLAN ID for the Traffic Mirror session. For more information about the VXLAN protocol, see RFC 7348. If you do not specify a VirtualNetworkId, an account-wide unique id is chosen at random.
