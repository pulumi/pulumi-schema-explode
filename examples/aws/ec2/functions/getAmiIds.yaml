        permission on  the image. Valid items are the numeric account ID or `self`.

      description: |
        One or more name/value pairs to filter off of. There
        are several valid keys, for a full reference, check out
        [describe-images in the AWS CLI reference][1].
    nameRegex:
      type: string
      description: |
        Regex string to apply to the AMI list returned
        by AWS. This allows more advanced filtering not supported from the AWS API.
        This filtering is done locally on what AWS returns, and could have a performance
        impact if the result is large. Combine this with other
        options to narrow down the list AWS returns.

        List of AMI owners to limit search. At least 1 value must be specified. Valid values: an AWS account ID, `self` (the current account), or an AWS owner alias (e.g., `amazon`, `aws-marketplace`, `microsoft`).
