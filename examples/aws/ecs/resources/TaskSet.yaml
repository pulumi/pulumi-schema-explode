  ## Import


  ECS Task Sets can be imported via the `task_set_id`, `service`, and `cluster` separated by commas (`,`) e.g.


  ```sh

  \ $ pulumi import aws:ecs/taskSet:TaskSet example ecs-svc/7177320696926227436,arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789101:service/example/example-1234567890,arn:aws:ecs:us-west-2:123456789101:cluster/example

  ```
