      A code which when added to the domain as a TXT record
      will signal to SES that the owner of the domain has authorised SES to act on
      their behalf. The domain identity will be in state "verification pending"
      until this is done. See below for an example of how this might be achieved
      when the domain is hosted in Route 53 and managed by this provider.  Find out
      more about verifying domains in Amazon SES in the [AWS SES
      docs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/verify-domains.html).
