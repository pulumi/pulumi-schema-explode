  classification:
    type: string
    description: |
      An identifier of the data format that the classifier matches.
    language:
      python:
        mapCase: false
  rowTag:
    type: string
    description: |
      The XML tag designating the element that contains each record in an XML document being parsed. Note that this cannot identify a self-closing element (closed by `/>`). An empty row element that contains only attributes can be parsed as long as it ends with a closing tag (for example, `<row item_a="A" item_b="B"></row>` is okay, but `<row item_a="A" item_b="B" />` is not).
