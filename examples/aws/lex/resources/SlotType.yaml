  checksum:
    type: string
    description: |
      Checksum identifying the version of the slot type that was created. The checksum is
      not included as an argument because the resource will add it automatically when updating the slot type.
  createVersion:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Determines if a new slot type version is created when the initial resource is created and on each
      update. Defaults to `false`.
  createdDate:
    type: string
    description: |
      The date when the slot type version was created.

      A description of the slot type. Must be less than or equal to 200 characters in length.
  enumerationValues:
    type: array
    items:
      $ref: "#/types/aws:lex/SlotTypeEnumerationValue:SlotTypeEnumerationValue"
    description: |
      A list of EnumerationValue objects that defines the values that
      the slot type can take. Each value can have a list of synonyms, which are additional values that help
      train the machine learning model about the values that it resolves for a slot. Attributes are
      documented under enumeration_value.
  lastUpdatedDate:
    type: string
    description: |
      The date when the `$LATEST` version of this slot type was updated.
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the slot type. The name is not case sensitive. Must be less than or equal to 100 characters in length.
  valueSelectionStrategy:
    type: string
    description: |
      Determines the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex
      uses to return slot type values. `ORIGINAL_VALUE` returns the value entered by the user if the user
      value is similar to the slot value. `TOP_RESOLUTION` returns the first value in the resolution list
      if there is a resolution list for the slot, otherwise null is returned. Defaults to `ORIGINAL_VALUE`.
