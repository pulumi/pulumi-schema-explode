    description: |
      Prompts the user to confirm the intent. This question should
      have a yes or no answer. You you must provide both the `rejection_statement` and `confirmation_prompt`,
      or neither. Attributes are documented under prompt.
  createVersion:
    type: boolean

  followUpPrompt:
    $ref: "#/types/aws:lex/IntentFollowUpPrompt:IntentFollowUpPrompt"
    description: |
      Amazon Lex uses this prompt to solicit additional activity after

      user to order a drink. The `follow_up_prompt` field and the `conclusion_statement` field are mutually
      exclusive. You can specify only one. Attributes are documented under follow_up_prompt.
