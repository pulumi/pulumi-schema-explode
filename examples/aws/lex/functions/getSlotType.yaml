      type: string
      description: |
        Checksum identifying the version of the slot type that was created. The checksum is
        not included as an argument because the resource will add it automatically when updating the slot type.

      description: |
        Set of EnumerationValue objects that defines the values that
        the slot type can take. Each value can have a set of synonyms, which are additional values that help
        train the machine learning model about the values that it resolves for a slot.
    id:
      type: string
      description: |
        The provider-assigned unique ID for this managed resource.

    valueSelectionStrategy:
      type: string
      description: |
        Determines the slot resolution strategy that Amazon Lex
        uses to return slot type values. `ORIGINAL_VALUE` returns the value entered by the user if the user
        value is similar to the slot value. `TOP_RESOLUTION` returns the first value in the resolution list
        if there is a resolution list for the slot, otherwise null is returned.
