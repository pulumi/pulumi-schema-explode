  engineNativeAuditFieldsIncluded:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Specifies whether the database activity stream includes engine-native audit fields. This option only applies to an Oracle DB instance. By default, no engine-native audit fields are included. Defaults `false`.
  kinesisStreamName:
