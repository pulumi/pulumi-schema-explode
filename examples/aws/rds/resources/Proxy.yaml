    description: |
      Configuration block(s) with authorization mechanisms to connect to the associated instances or clusters. Described below.
  debugLogging:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether the proxy includes detailed information about SQL statements in its logs. This information helps you to debug issues involving SQL behavior or the performance and scalability of the proxy connections. The debug information includes the text of SQL statements that you submit through the proxy. Thus, only enable this setting when needed for debugging, and only when you have security measures in place to safeguard any sensitive information that appears in the logs.
  endpoint:
    type: string
    description: |
      The endpoint that you can use to connect to the proxy. You include the endpoint value in the connection string for a database client application.
  engineFamily:
    type: string
    description: |
      The kinds of databases that the proxy can connect to. This value determines which database network protocol the proxy recognizes when it interprets network traffic to and from the database. The engine family applies to MySQL and PostgreSQL for both RDS and Aurora. Valid values are `MYSQL` and `POSTGRESQL`.
  idleClientTimeout:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The number of seconds that a connection to the proxy can be inactive before the proxy disconnects it. You can set this value higher or lower than the connection timeout limit for the associated database.
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      The identifier for the proxy. This name must be unique for all proxies owned by your AWS account in the specified AWS Region. An identifier must begin with a letter and must contain only ASCII letters, digits, and hyphens; it can't end with a hyphen or contain two consecutive hyphens.
  requireTls:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      A Boolean parameter that specifies whether Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is required for connections to the proxy. By enabling this setting, you can enforce encrypted TLS connections to the proxy.
  roleArn:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that the proxy uses to access secrets in AWS Secrets Manager.
  tags:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      A mapping of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
  tagsAll:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
  vpcSecurityGroupIds:
    type: array
    items:

      One or more VPC security group IDs to associate with the new proxy.
  vpcSubnetIds:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      One or more VPC subnet IDs to associate with the new proxy.
