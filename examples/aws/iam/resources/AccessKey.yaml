      Secret access key. This attribute is not available for imported resources. Note that this will be written to the state file. If you use this, please protect your backend state file judiciously. Alternatively, you may supply a `pgp_key` instead, which will prevent the secret from being stored in plaintext, at the cost of preventing the use of the secret key in automation.

      Secret access key converted into an SES SMTP password by applying [AWS's documented Sigv4 conversion algorithm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/smtp-credentials.html#smtp-credentials-convert).

As SigV4 is region specific, valid Provider regions are `ap-south-1`, `ap-southeast-2`, `eu-central-1`, `eu-west-1`, `us-east-1` and `us-west-2`. See current [AWS SES regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#ses_region).
