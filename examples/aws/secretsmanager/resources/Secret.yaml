  kmsKeyId:

    description: |
      ARN, Key ID, or Alias of the AWS KMS key within the region secret is replicated to. If one is not specified, then Secrets Manager defaults to using the AWS account's default KMS key (`aws/secretsmanager`) in the region or creates one for use if non-existent.
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      Friendly name of the new secret. The secret name can consist of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and any of the following characters: `/_+=.@-` Conflicts with `name_prefix`.
  namePrefix:

    description: |
      Creates a unique name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `name`.

    type: string
    description: |
      Valid JSON document representing a [resource policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/auth-and-access_resource-based-policies.html). Removing `policy` from your configuration or setting `policy` to null or an empty string (i.e., `policy = ""`) _will not_ delete the policy since it could have been set by `aws.secretsmanager.SecretPolicy`. To delete the `policy`, set it to `"{}"` (an empty JSON document).
  recoveryWindowInDays:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Number of days that AWS Secrets Manager waits before it can delete the secret. This value can be `0` to force deletion without recovery or range from `7` to `30` days. The default value is `30`.
