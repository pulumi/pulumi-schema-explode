properties:
  adjustmentType:
    type: string
    description: |
      Whether the adjustment is an absolute number or a percentage of the current capacity. Valid values are `ChangeInCapacity`, `ExactCapacity`, and `PercentChangeInCapacity`.
  arn:
    type: string
    description: |
      ARN assigned by AWS to the scaling policy.
  autoscalingGroupName:
    type: string
    description: |
      Name of the autoscaling group.
  cooldown:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Amount of time, in seconds, after a scaling activity completes and before the next scaling activity can start.
  enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Whether the scaling policy is enabled or disabled. Default: `true`.
  estimatedInstanceWarmup:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Estimated time, in seconds, until a newly launched instance will contribute CloudWatch metrics. Without a value, AWS will default to the group's specified cooldown period.
  metricAggregationType:
    type: string
    description: |
      Aggregation type for the policy's metrics. Valid values are "Minimum", "Maximum", and "Average". Without a value, AWS will treat the aggregation type as "Average".
  minAdjustmentMagnitude:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Minimum value to scale by when `adjustment_type` is set to `PercentChangeInCapacity`.
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      Name of the dimension.
  policyType:
    type: string
    description: |
      Policy type, either "SimpleScaling", "StepScaling", "TargetTrackingScaling", or "PredictiveScaling". If this value isn't provided, AWS will default to "SimpleScaling."

  scalingAdjustment:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Number of members by which to
      scale, when the adjustment bounds are breached. A positive value scales
