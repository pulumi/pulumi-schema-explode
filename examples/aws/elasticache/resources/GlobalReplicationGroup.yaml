  ## Import


  ElastiCache Global Replication Groups can be imported using the `global_replication_group_id`, e.g.,


  ```sh

  \ $ pulumi import aws:elasticache/globalReplicationGroup:GlobalReplicationGroup my_global_replication_group okuqm-global-replication-group-1

  ```

      The ARN of the ElastiCache Global Replication Group.
  atRestEncryptionEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      A flag that indicate whether the encryption at rest is enabled.
  authTokenEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      A flag that indicate whether AuthToken (password) is enabled.
  cacheNodeType:
    type: string
    description: |
      The instance class used. See AWS documentation for information on [supported node types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/CacheNodes.SupportedTypes.html) and [guidance on selecting node types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/red-ug/nodes-select-size.html).
  clusterEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates whether the Global Datastore is cluster enabled.
  engine:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name of the cache engine to be used for the clusters in this global replication group.
  engineVersion:
    type: string
    description: |
      Redis version to use for the Global Replication Group.
      When creating, by default the Global Replication Group inherits the version of the primary replication group.
      If a version is specified, the Global Replication Group and all member replication groups will be upgraded to this version.
      Cannot be downgraded without replacing the Global Replication Group and all member replication groups.
      If the version is 6 or higher, the major and minor version can be set, e.g., `6.2`,
      or the minor version can be unspecified which will use the latest version at creation time, e.g., `6.x`.
      The actual engine version used is returned in the attribute `engine_version_actual`, see Attributes Reference below.
  engineVersionActual:
    type: string
    description: |
      The full version number of the cache engine running on the members of this global replication group.

    type: string
    description: |
      An ElastiCache Parameter Group to use for the Global Replication Group.
      Required when upgrading a major engine version, but will be ignored if left configured after the upgrade is complete.
      Specifying without a major version upgrade will fail.
      Note that ElastiCache creates a copy of this parameter group for each member replication group.
  primaryReplicationGroupId:
    type: string
    description: |
      The ID of the primary cluster that accepts writes and will replicate updates to the secondary cluster. If `primary_replication_group_id` is changed, creates a new resource.
