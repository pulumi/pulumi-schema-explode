  bypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety check.
      Setting this value to true increases the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.
      For more information, refer to the scenario in the [Default Key Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam) section in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.
      The default value is `false`.

    type: integer
    description: |
      The waiting period, specified in number of days. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key.
      If you specify a value, it must be between `7` and `30`, inclusive. If you do not specify a value, it defaults to `30`.
