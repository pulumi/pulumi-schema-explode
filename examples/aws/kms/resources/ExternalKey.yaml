properties:
  arn:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the key.
  bypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Specifies whether to disable the policy lockout check performed when creating or updating the key's policy. Setting this value to `true` increases the risk that the key becomes unmanageable. For more information, refer to the scenario in the [Default Key Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam) section in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide. Defaults to `false`.
  deletionWindowInDays:
    type: integer
    description: |
      Duration in days after which the key is deleted after destruction of the resource. Must be between `7` and `30` days. Defaults to `30`.
  description:
    type: string
    description: |
      Description of the key.
  enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Specifies whether the key is enabled. Keys pending import can only be `false`. Imported keys default to `true` unless expired.
  expirationModel:
    type: string
    description: |
      Whether the key material expires. Empty when pending key material import, otherwise `KEY_MATERIAL_EXPIRES` or `KEY_MATERIAL_DOES_NOT_EXPIRE`.
  keyMaterialBase64:
    type: string
    description: |
      Base64 encoded 256-bit symmetric encryption key material to import. The CMK is permanently associated with this key material. The same key material can be reimported, but you cannot import different key material.
  keyState:
    type: string
    description: |
      The state of the CMK.
  keyUsage:
    type: string
    description: |
      The cryptographic operations for which you can use the CMK.
  multiRegion:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Indicates whether the KMS key is a multi-Region (`true`) or regional (`false`) key. Defaults to `false`.
  policy:
    type: string
    description: |
      A key policy JSON document. If you do not provide a key policy, AWS KMS attaches a default key policy to the CMK.
  tags:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      A key-value map of tags to assign to the key. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
  tagsAll:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
  validTo:
    type: string
    description: |
      Time at which the imported key material expires. When the key material expires, AWS KMS deletes the key material and the CMK becomes unusable. If not specified, key material does not expire. Valid values: [RFC3339 time string](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`)
