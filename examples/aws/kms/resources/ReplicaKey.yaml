properties:
  arn:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replica key. The key ARNs of related multi-Region keys differ only in the Region value.
  bypassPolicyLockoutSafetyCheck:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      A flag to indicate whether to bypass the key policy lockout safety check.
      Setting this value to true increases the risk that the KMS key becomes unmanageable. Do not set this value to true indiscriminately.
      For more information, refer to the scenario in the [Default Key Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/key-policies.html#key-policy-default-allow-root-enable-iam) section in the _AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide_.
      The default value is `false`.
  deletionWindowInDays:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The waiting period, specified in number of days. After the waiting period ends, AWS KMS deletes the KMS key.
      If you specify a value, it must be between `7` and `30`, inclusive. If you do not specify a value, it defaults to `30`.

    description: |
      A description of the KMS key.
  enabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Specifies whether the replica key is enabled. Disabled KMS keys cannot be used in cryptographic operations. The default value is `true`.

  keyRotationEnabled:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      A Boolean value that specifies whether key rotation is enabled. This is a shared property of multi-Region keys.

    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
