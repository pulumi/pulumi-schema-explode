  outputFormat:

      Output format for the stream. Possible values are `json` and `opentelemetry0.7`. For more information about output formats, see [Metric streams output formats](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-metric-streams-formats.html).

    description: |
      For each entry in this array, you specify one or more metrics and the list of additional statistics to stream for those metrics. The additional statistics that you can stream depend on the stream's `output_format`. If the OutputFormat is `json`, you can stream any additional statistic that is supported by CloudWatch, listed in [CloudWatch statistics definitions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Statistics-definitions.html.html). If the OutputFormat is `opentelemetry0.7`, you can stream percentile statistics (p99 etc.). See details below.
