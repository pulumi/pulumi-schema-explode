inputs:
  description: |
    A collection of arguments for invoking getJobQueue.
  properties:
    name:
      type: string
      description: |
        Name of the job queue.
    tags:
      type: object
      additionalProperties:
        type: string
      description: |
        Key-value map of resource tags

    - name
outputs:
  description: |
    A collection of values returned by getJobQueue.
  properties:
    arn:
      type: string
      description: |
        ARN of the job queue.
    computeEnvironmentOrders:
      type: array
      items:
        $ref: "#/types/aws:batch/getJobQueueComputeEnvironmentOrder:getJobQueueComputeEnvironmentOrder"
      description: |
        The compute environments that are attached to the job queue and the order in
        which job placement is preferred. Compute environments are selected for job placement in ascending order.
        * `compute_environment_order.#.order` - The order of the compute environment.
        * `compute_environment_order.#.compute_environment` - The ARN of the compute environment.
    id:
      type: string
      description: |
        The provider-assigned unique ID for this managed resource.
    name:
      type: string
    priority:
      type: integer
      description: |
        Priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority are evaluated first when
        associated with the same compute environment.
    schedulingPolicyArn:
      type: string
      description: |
        The ARN of the fair share scheduling policy. If this attribute has a value, the job queue uses a fair share scheduling policy. If this attribute does not have a value, the job queue uses a first in, first out (FIFO) scheduling policy.
    state:
      type: string
      description: |
        Describes the ability of the queue to accept new jobs (for example, `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`).
    status:
      type: string
      description: |
        Current status of the job queue (for example, `CREATING` or `VALID`).
    statusReason:
      type: string
      description: |
        Short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status
        of the job queue.
