properties:
  arn:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Amazon Resource Name of the job queue.
  computeEnvironments:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |
      Specifies the set of compute environments
      mapped to a job queue and their order.  The position of the compute environments
      in the list will dictate the order.
  name:
    type: string
    description: |
      Specifies the name of the job queue.
  priority:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority
      are evaluated first when associated with the same compute environment.
  schedulingPolicyArn:
    type: string
    description: |
      The ARN of the fair share scheduling policy. If this parameter is specified, the job queue uses a fair share scheduling policy. If this parameter isn't specified, the job queue uses a first in, first out (FIFO) scheduling policy. After a job queue is created, you can replace but can't remove the fair share scheduling policy.
  state:
    type: string
    description: |
      The state of the job queue. Must be one of: `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`
  tags:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      Key-value map of resource tags. .If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.
  tagsAll:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
