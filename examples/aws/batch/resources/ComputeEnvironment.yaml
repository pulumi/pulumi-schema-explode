properties:
  arn:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the compute environment.
  computeEnvironmentName:
    type: string
    description: |
      The name for your compute environment. Up to 128 letters (uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and underscores are allowed. If omitted, this provider will assign a random, unique name.
  computeEnvironmentNamePrefix:
    type: string
    description: |
      Creates a unique compute environment name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `compute_environment_name`.
  computeResources:
    $ref: "#/types/aws:batch/ComputeEnvironmentComputeResources:ComputeEnvironmentComputeResources"
    description: |
      Details of the compute resources managed by the compute environment. This parameter is required for managed compute environments. See details below.
  ecsClusterArn:
    type: string
    description: |
      The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the underlying Amazon ECS cluster used by the compute environment.
  serviceRole:
    type: string
    description: |
      The full Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IAM role that allows AWS Batch to make calls to other AWS services on your behalf.
  state:
    type: string
    description: |
      The state of the compute environment. If the state is `ENABLED`, then the compute environment accepts jobs from a queue and can scale out automatically based on queues. Valid items are `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. Defaults to `ENABLED`.
  status:
    type: string
    description: |
      The current status of the compute environment (for example, CREATING or VALID).
  statusReason:
    type: string
    description: |
      A short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status of the compute environment.
  tags:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      Key-value pair tags to be applied to resources that are launched in the compute environment. This parameter isn't applicable to jobs running on Fargate resources, and shouldn't be specified.
  tagsAll:
    type: object
    additionalProperties:
      type: string
    description: |
      A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.
  type:
    type: string
    description: |
      The type of compute environment. Valid items are `EC2`, `SPOT`, `FARGATE` or `FARGATE_SPOT`.
