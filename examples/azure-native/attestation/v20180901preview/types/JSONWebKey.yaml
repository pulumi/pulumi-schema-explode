properties:
  alg:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The "alg" (algorithm) parameter identifies the algorithm intended for
      use with the key.  The values used should either be registered in the
      IANA "JSON Web Signature and Encryption Algorithms" registry
      established by [JWA] or be a value that contains a Collision-
      Resistant Name.
  crv:
    type: string
    description: The "crv" (curve) parameter identifies the curve type
  d:

    description: RSA private exponent or ECC private key
  dp:

  dq:

  e:

    description: RSA public exponent, in Base64
  k:
    type: string
    description: Symmetric key
  kid:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The "kid" (key ID) parameter is used to match a specific key.  This
      is used, for instance, to choose among a set of keys within a JWK Set
      during key rollover.  The structure of the "kid" value is
      unspecified.  When "kid" values are used within a JWK Set, different
      keys within the JWK Set SHOULD use distinct "kid" values.  (One
      example in which different keys might use the same "kid" value is if
      they have different "kty" (key type) values but are considered to be
      equivalent alternatives by the application using them.)  The "kid"
      value is a case-sensitive string.
  kty:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The "kty" (key type) parameter identifies the cryptographic algorithm
      family used with the key, such as "RSA" or "EC". "kty" values should
      either be registered in the IANA "JSON Web Key Types" registry
      established by [JWA] or be a value that contains a Collision-
      Resistant Name.  The "kty" value is a case-sensitive string.
  n:
    type: string
    description: RSA modulus, in Base64
  p:

    description: RSA secret prime
  q:
    type: string
    description: RSA secret prime, with p < q
  qi:
    type: string
    description: RSA Private Key Parameter
  use:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Use ("public key use") identifies the intended use of
      the public key. The "use" parameter is employed to indicate whether
      a public key is used for encrypting data or verifying the signature
      on data. Values are commonly "sig" (signature) or "enc" (encryption).
  x:
    type: string
    description: X coordinate for the Elliptic Curve point
  x5c:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
    description: |-
      The "x5c" (X.509 certificate chain) parameter contains a chain of one
      or more PKIX certificates [RFC5280].  The certificate chain is
      represented as a JSON array of certificate value strings.  Each
      string in the array is a base64-encoded (Section 4 of [RFC4648] --
      not base64url-encoded) DER [ITU.X690.1994] PKIX certificate value.
      The PKIX certificate containing the key value MUST be the first
      certificate.
