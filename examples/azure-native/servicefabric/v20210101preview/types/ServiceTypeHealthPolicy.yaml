description: |
  Represents the health policy used to evaluate the health of services belonging to a service type.
properties:
  maxPercentUnhealthyPartitionsPerService:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy partitions per service.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of partitions that can be unhealthy before the service is considered in error.
      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy partition, the health is evaluated as Warning.
      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy partitions over the total number of partitions in the service.
      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of partitions.
  maxPercentUnhealthyReplicasPerPartition:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy replicas per partition.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of replicas that can be unhealthy before the partition is considered in error.
      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy replica, the health is evaluated as Warning.
      The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy replicas over the total number of replicas in the partition.
      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of replicas.
  maxPercentUnhealthyServices:
    type: integer
    description: |
      The maximum allowed percentage of unhealthy services.

      The percentage represents the maximum tolerated percentage of services that can be unhealthy before the application is considered in error.
      If the percentage is respected but there is at least one unhealthy service, the health is evaluated as Warning.
      This is calculated by dividing the number of unhealthy services of the specific service type over the total number of services of the specific service type.
      The computation rounds up to tolerate one failure on small numbers of services.
