    description: Specifies the move cost for the service.
  instanceCount:
    type: integer
    description: The instance count.
  minInstanceCount:
    type: integer
    description: MinInstanceCount is the minimum number of instances that must be up to meet the EnsureAvailability safety check during operations like upgrade or deactivate node. The actual number that is used is max( MinInstanceCount, ceil( MinInstancePercentage/100.0 * InstanceCount) ). Note, if InstanceCount is set to -1, during MinInstanceCount computation -1 is first converted into the number of nodes on which the instances are allowed to be placed according to the placement constraints on the service.
  minInstancePercentage:
    type: integer
    description: MinInstancePercentage is the minimum percentage of InstanceCount that must be up to meet the EnsureAvailability safety check during operations like upgrade or deactivate node. The actual number that is used is max( MinInstanceCount, ceil( MinInstancePercentage/100.0 * InstanceCount) ). Note, if InstanceCount is set to -1, during MinInstancePercentage computation, -1 is first converted into the number of nodes on which the instances are allowed to be placed according to the placement constraints on the service.

  placementConstraints:
    type: string
    description: 'The placement constraints as a string. Placement constraints are boolean expressions on node properties and allow for restricting a service to particular nodes based on the service requirements. For example, to place a service on nodes where NodeType is blue specify the following: "NodeColor == blue)".'
