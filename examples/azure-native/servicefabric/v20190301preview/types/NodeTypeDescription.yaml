        - Bronze - No privileges. This is the default.
        - Silver - The infrastructure jobs can be paused for a duration of 10 minutes per UD.
        - Gold - The infrastructure jobs can be paused for a duration of 2 hours per UD. Gold durability can be enabled only on full node VM skus like D15_V2, G5 etc.
