description: Represents a scaling policy related to an average load of a metric/resource of a service.
properties:
  kind:
    type: string
    description: |-
      Enumerates the ways that a service can be partitioned.
      Expected value is 'AverageServiceLoadTrigger'.
    const: AverageServiceLoadTrigger
  lowerLoadThreshold:
    type: number
    description: The lower limit of the load below which a scale in operation should be performed.
  metricName:
    type: string
    description: The name of the metric for which usage should be tracked.
  scaleInterval:
    type: string
    description: The period in seconds on which a decision is made whether to scale or not. This property should come in ISO 8601 format "hh:mm:ss".
  upperLoadThreshold:
    type: number
    description: The upper limit of the load beyond which a scale out operation should be performed.
  useOnlyPrimaryLoad:
    type: boolean
    description: Flag determines whether only the load of primary replica should be considered for scaling. If set to true, then trigger will only consider the load of primary replicas of stateful service. If set to false, trigger will consider load of all replicas. This parameter cannot be set to true for stateless service.
