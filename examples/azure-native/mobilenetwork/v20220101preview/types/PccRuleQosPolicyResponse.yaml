description: PCC rule QoS policy
properties:
  allocationAndRetentionPriorityLevel:
    type: integer
    description: QoS Flow allocation and retention priority (ARP) level. Flows with higher priority preempt flows with lower priority, if the settings of `preemptionCapability` and `preemptionVulnerability` allow it. 1 is the highest level of priority. If this field is not specified then `5qi` is used to derive the ARP value. See 3GPP TS23.501 section 5.7.2.2 for a full description of the ARP parameters.
    default: 9
  fiveQi:
    type: integer
    description: "QoS Flow 5G QoS Indicator value.  The 5QI identifies a specific QoS forwarding treatment to be provided to a flow. This must not be a standardized 5QI value selecting a GBR (Guaranteed Bit Rate) QoS.  The illegal GBR 5QI values are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 65, 66, 67, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 82, 83, 84, and 85. See 3GPP TS23.501 section 5.7.2.1 for a full description of the 5Qi parameter, and table 5.7.4-1 for the definition of which are the GBR 5QI values."
    default: 9
  guaranteedBitRate:
    type: object
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:mobilenetwork/v20220101preview:AmbrResponse"
    description: The Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) for all service data flows that use this PCC Rule. This is an optional setting. If you do not provide a value, there will be no GBR set for the PCC Rule that uses this QoS definition.
  maximumBitRate:
    type: object
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:mobilenetwork/v20220101preview:AmbrResponse"
    description: The Maximum Bit Rate (MBR) for all service data flows that use this PCC Rule or Service.
  preemptionCapability:
    type: string
    description: QoS Flow preemption capability.  The Preemption Capability of a QoS Flow controls whether it can preempt another QoS Flow with a lower priority level. See 3GPP TS23.501 section 5.7.2.2 for a full description of the ARP parameters.
    default: NotPreempt
  preemptionVulnerability:
    type: string
    description: QoS Flow preemption vulnerability.  The Preemption Vulnerability of a QoS Flow controls whether it can be preempted by QoS Flow with a higher priority level. See 3GPP TS23.501 section 5.7.2.2 for a full description of the ARP parameters.
    default: Preemptable
