    description: Specifies how the virtual machine should be created.<br><br> Possible values are:<br><br> **Attach** \u2013 This value is used when you are using a specialized disk to create the virtual machine.<br><br> **FromImage** \u2013 This value is used when you are using an image to create the virtual machine. If you are using a platform image, you also use the imageReference element described above. If you are using a marketplace image, you  also use the plan element previously described.

    description: "Specifies whether data disk should be deleted or detached upon VM deletion.<br><br> Possible values: <br><br> **Delete** If this value is used, the data disk is deleted when VM is deleted.<br><br> **Detach** If this value is used, the data disk is retained after VM is deleted.<br><br> The default value is set to **detach**"
  detachOption:
    oneOf:
      - type: string
      - $ref: "#/types/azure-native:compute/v20210301:DiskDetachOptionTypes"
    description: "Specifies the detach behavior to be used while detaching a disk or which is already in the process of detachment from the virtual machine. Supported values: **ForceDetach**. <br><br> detachOption: **ForceDetach** is applicable only for managed data disks. If a previous detachment attempt of the data disk did not complete due to an unexpected failure from the virtual machine and the disk is still not released then use force-detach as a last resort option to detach the disk forcibly from the VM. All writes might not have been flushed when using this detach behavior. <br><br> This feature is still in preview mode and is not supported for VirtualMachineScaleSet. To force-detach a data disk update toBeDetached to 'true' along with setting detachOption: 'ForceDetach'."

  lun:
    type: integer
    description: Specifies the logical unit number of the data disk. This value is used to identify data disks within the VM and therefore must be unique for each data disk attached to a VM.
