Specifies the detach behavior to be used while detaching a disk or which is already in the process of detachment from the virtual machine. Supported values: **ForceDetach**. <br><br> detachOption: **ForceDetach** is applicable only for managed data disks. If a previous detachment attempt of the data disk did not complete due to an unexpected failure from the virtual machine and the disk is still not released then use force-detach as a last resort option to detach the disk forcibly from the VM. All writes might not have been flushed when using this detach behavior. <br><br> This feature is still in preview mode and is not supported for VirtualMachineScaleSet. To force-detach a data disk update toBeDetached to 'true' along with setting detachOption: 'ForceDetach'.
