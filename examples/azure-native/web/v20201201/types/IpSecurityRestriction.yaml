      X-Forwarded-Host (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-Host#Examples). 
      The matching logic is ..
      - If the property is null or empty (default), all hosts(or lack of) are allowed.
      - A value is compared using ordinal-ignore-case (excluding port number).
      - Subdomain wildcards are permitted but don't match the root domain. For example, *.contoso.com matches the subdomain foo.contoso.com
       but not the root domain contoso.com or multi-level foo.bar.contoso.com
      - Unicode host names are allowed but are converted to Punycode for matching.

      X-Forwarded-For (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/X-Forwarded-For#Examples).
      The matching logic is ..
      - If the property is null or empty (default), any forwarded-for chains (or lack of) are allowed.
      - If any address (excluding port number) in the chain (comma separated) matches the CIDR defined by the property.

      X-Azure-FDID and X-FD-HealthProbe.
      The matching logic is exact match.

      It can be in form of pure ipv4 address (required SubnetMask property) or
      CIDR notation such as ipv4/mask (leading bit match). For CIDR,
      SubnetMask property must not be specified.
