description: Routing rules for ramp up testing. This rule allows to redirect static traffic % to a slot or to gradually change routing % based on performance.
properties:
  actionHostName:
    type: string
    description: Hostname of a slot to which the traffic will be redirected if decided to. E.g. myapp-stage.azurewebsites.net.
  changeDecisionCallbackUrl:
    type: string

      Custom decision algorithm can be provided in TiPCallback site extension which URL can be specified. See TiPCallback site extension for the scaffold and contracts.

  changeIntervalInMinutes:
    type: integer

  changeStep:
    type: number
    description: |-
      In auto ramp up scenario this is the step to add/remove from <code>ReroutePercentage</code> until it reaches \n<code>MinReroutePercentage</code> or 
      <code>MaxReroutePercentage</code>. Site metrics are checked every N minutes specified in <code>ChangeIntervalInMinutes</code>.\nCustom decision algorithm 
      can be provided in TiPCallback site extension which URL can be specified in <code>ChangeDecisionCallbackUrl</code>.
  maxReroutePercentage:
    type: number
    description: Specifies upper boundary below which ReroutePercentage will stay.
  minReroutePercentage:
    type: number
    description: Specifies lower boundary above which ReroutePercentage will stay.
  name:
    type: string
    description: Name of the routing rule. The recommended name would be to point to the slot which will receive the traffic in the experiment.
  reroutePercentage:
    type: number
