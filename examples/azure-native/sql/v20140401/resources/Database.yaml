      Specifies the mode of database creation.

      Default: regular database creation.

      Copy: creates a database as a copy of an existing database. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the resource ID of the source database.

      OnlineSecondary/NonReadableSecondary: creates a database as a (readable or nonreadable) secondary replica of an existing database. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the resource ID of the existing primary database.

      PointInTimeRestore: Creates a database by restoring a point in time backup of an existing database. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the resource ID of the existing database, and restorePointInTime must be specified.

      Recovery: Creates a database by restoring a geo-replicated backup. sourceDatabaseId must be specified as the recoverable database resource ID to restore.
