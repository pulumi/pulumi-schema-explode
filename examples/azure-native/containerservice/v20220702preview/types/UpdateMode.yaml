description: "Each update mode level is a superset of the lower levels. Off<Initial<Recreate<=Auto. For example: if UpdateMode is Initial, it means VPA sets the recommended resources in the VerticalPodAutoscaler Custom Resource (from UpdateMode Off) and also assigns resources on pod creation (from Initial). The default value is Off."
type: string
enum:
  - description: Autoscaler never changes pod resources but provides recommendations.
    value: Off
  - description: Autoscaler only assigns resources on pod creation and doesn't change them during the lifetime of the pod.
    value: Initial
  - description: Autoscaler assigns resources on pod creation and updates pods that need further scaling during their lifetime by deleting and recreating.
    value: Recreate
  - description: Autoscaler chooses the update mode. Autoscaler currently does the same as Recreate. In the future, it may take advantage of restart-free mechanisms once they are available.
    value: Auto
