    kubernetesVersion:
      type: string
      description: Both patch version <major.minor.patch> (e.g. 1.20.13) and <major.minor> (e.g. 1.20) are supported. When <major.minor> is specified, the latest supported GA patch version is chosen automatically. Updating the cluster with the same <major.minor> once it has been created (e.g. 1.14.x -> 1.14) will not trigger an upgrade, even if a newer patch version is available. When you upgrade a supported AKS cluster, Kubernetes minor versions cannot be skipped. All upgrades must be performed sequentially by major version number. For example, upgrades between 1.14.x -> 1.15.x or 1.15.x -> 1.16.x are allowed, however 1.14.x -> 1.16.x is not allowed. See [upgrading an AKS cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/aks/upgrade-cluster) for more details.
