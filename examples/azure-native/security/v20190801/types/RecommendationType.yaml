description: The type of IoT Security recommendation.
type: string
enum:
  - description: Authentication schema used for pull an edge module from an ACR repository does not use Service Principal Authentication.
    value: IoT_ACRAuthentication
  - description: IoT agent message size capacity is currently underutilized, causing an increase in the number of sent messages. Adjust message intervals for better utilization.
    value: IoT_AgentSendsUnutilizedMessages
  - description: Identified security related system configuration issues.
    value: IoT_Baseline
  - description: You can optimize Edge Hub memory usage by turning off protocol heads for any protocols not used by Edge modules in your solution.
    value: IoT_EdgeHubMemOptimize
  - description: Logging is disabled for this edge module.
    value: IoT_EdgeLoggingOptions
  - description: A minority within a device security group has inconsistent Edge Module settings with the rest of their group.
    value: IoT_InconsistentModuleSettings
  - description: Install the Azure Security of Things Agent.
    value: IoT_InstallAgent
  - description: IP Filter Configuration should have rules defined for allowed traffic and should deny all other traffic by default.
    value: IoT_IPFilter_DenyAll
  - description: An Allow IP Filter rules source IP range is too large. Overly permissive rules might expose your IoT hub to malicious intenders.
    value: IoT_IPFilter_PermissiveRule
  - description: A listening endpoint was found on the device.
    value: IoT_OpenPorts
  - description: An Allowed firewall policy was found (INPUT/OUTPUT). The policy should Deny all traffic by default and define rules to allow necessary communication to/from the device.
    value: IoT_PermissiveFirewallPolicy
  - description: A rule in the firewall has been found that contains a permissive pattern for a wide range of IP addresses or Ports.
    value: IoT_PermissiveInputFirewallRules
  - description: A rule in the firewall has been found that contains a permissive pattern for a wide range of IP addresses or Ports.
    value: IoT_PermissiveOutputFirewallRules
  - description: Edge module is configured to run in privileged mode, with extensive Linux capabilities or with host-level network access (send/receive data to host machine).
    value: IoT_PrivilegedDockerOptions
  - description: Same authentication credentials to the IoT Hub used by multiple devices. This could indicate an illegitimate device impersonating a legitimate device. It also exposes the risk of device impersonation by an attacker.
    value: IoT_SharedCredentials
  - description: Insecure TLS configurations detected. Immediate upgrade recommended.
    value: IoT_VulnerableTLSCipherSuite
