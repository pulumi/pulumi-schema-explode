  dividePerInstance:
    type: boolean
    description: a value indicating whether metric should divide per instance.
  metricName:
    type: string
    description: the name of the metric that defines what the rule monitors.
  metricNamespace:
    type: string
    description: the namespace of the metric that defines what the rule monitors.
  metricResourceLocation:
    type: string
    description: the location of the resource the rule monitors.
  metricResourceUri:
    type: string
    description: the resource identifier of the resource the rule monitors.
  operator:
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:insights/v20150401:ComparisonOperationType"
    description: the operator that is used to compare the metric data and the threshold.
  statistic:
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:insights/v20150401:MetricStatisticType"
    description: the metric statistic type. How the metrics from multiple instances are combined.
  threshold:
    type: number
    description: the threshold of the metric that triggers the scale action.
  timeAggregation:
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:insights/v20150401:TimeAggregationType"
    description: time aggregation type. How the data that is collected should be combined over time. The default value is Average.
  timeGrain:
    type: string
    description: the granularity of metrics the rule monitors. Must be one of the predefined values returned from metric definitions for the metric. Must be between 12 hours and 1 minute.
  timeWindow:
    type: string
    description: the range of time in which instance data is collected. This value must be greater than the delay in metric collection, which can vary from resource-to-resource. Must be between 12 hours and 5 minutes.
