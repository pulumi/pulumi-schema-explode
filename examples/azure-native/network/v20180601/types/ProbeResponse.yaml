properties:
  etag:
    type: string
    description: A unique read-only string that changes whenever the resource is updated.
  id:
    type: string
    description: Resource ID.
  intervalInSeconds:
    type: integer
    description: The interval, in seconds, for how frequently to probe the endpoint for health status. Typically, the interval is slightly less than half the allocated timeout period (in seconds) which allows two full probes before taking the instance out of rotation. The default value is 15, the minimum value is 5.
  loadBalancingRules:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      $ref: "#/types/azure-native:network/v20180601:SubResourceResponse"
    description: The load balancer rules that use this probe.
  name:
    type: string
    description: Gets name of the resource that is unique within a resource group. This name can be used to access the resource.
  numberOfProbes:
    type: integer
    description: The number of probes where if no response, will result in stopping further traffic from being delivered to the endpoint. This values allows endpoints to be taken out of rotation faster or slower than the typical times used in Azure.
  port:

    description: "Gets the provisioning state of the public IP resource. Possible values are: 'Updating', 'Deleting', and 'Failed'."
  requestPath:
    type: string
    description: The URI used for requesting health status from the VM. Path is required if a protocol is set to http. Otherwise, it is not allowed. There is no default value.
