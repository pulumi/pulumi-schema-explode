      description: Defines an port range to be used by inbound NAT Pools. Inbound NAT pools are used to define a range of NAT ports to be used by a VMSS cluster. After the creation of an inbound NAT pool, individual inbound NAT rules are automatically created for every VM in a VMSS cluster.  Defining inbound NAT rules on your load balancer is mutually exclusive with defining an inbound NAT pool. Inbound NAT pools are associated with VMSS, while inbound NAT rules are associated with individual VMs.
