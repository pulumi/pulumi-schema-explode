description: A load balancer probe.
properties:
  etag:
    type: string
    description: A unique read-only string that changes whenever the resource is updated.
  id:
    type: string
    description: Resource ID.
  intervalInSeconds:
    type: integer
    description: The interval, in seconds, for how frequently to probe the endpoint for health status. Typically, the interval is slightly less than half the allocated timeout period (in seconds) which allows two full probes before taking the instance out of rotation. The default value is 15, the minimum value is 5.
  loadBalancingRules:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      $ref: "#/types/azure-native:network/v20190801:SubResourceResponse"
    description: The load balancer rules that use this probe.
  name:
    type: string
    description: The name of the resource that is unique within the set of probes used by the load balancer. This name can be used to access the resource.
  numberOfProbes:
    type: integer
    description: The number of probes where if no response, will result in stopping further traffic from being delivered to the endpoint. This values allows endpoints to be taken out of rotation faster or slower than the typical times used in Azure.
  port:
    type: integer
    description: The port for communicating the probe. Possible values range from 1 to 65535, inclusive.
  protocol:
    type: string
    description: The protocol of the end point. If 'Tcp' is specified, a received ACK is required for the probe to be successful. If 'Http' or 'Https' is specified, a 200 OK response from the specifies URI is required for the probe to be successful.
  provisioningState:
    type: string
    description: The provisioning state of the probe resource.
  requestPath:
    type: string
    description: The URI used for requesting health status from the VM. Path is required if a protocol is set to http. Otherwise, it is not allowed. There is no default value.
  type:
