description: This class can be used as the Type for any secret entity represented as Value, ValueCertificateThumbprint, EncryptionAlgorithm. In this case, "Value" is a secret and the "valueThumbprint" represents the certificate thumbprint of the value. The algorithm field is mainly for future usage to potentially allow different entities encrypted using different algorithms.
inputs:
  properties:
    managerName:
      type: string
      description: The manager name
    resourceGroupName:
      type: string
      description: The resource group name
  type: object
  required:
    - managerName
    - resourceGroupName

  properties:
    encryptionAlgorithm:
      type: string
      description: Algorithm used to encrypt "Value"
    value:
      type: string
      description: The value of the secret itself. If the secret is in plaintext or null then EncryptionAlgorithm will be none
    valueCertificateThumbprint:
      type: string
      description: Thumbprint cert that was used to encrypt "Value"
  type: object
  required:
    - encryptionAlgorithm
    - value
