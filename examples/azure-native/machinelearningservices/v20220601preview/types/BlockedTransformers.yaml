type: string
enum:
  - description: Target encoding for text data.
    value: TextTargetEncoder
  - description: Ohe hot encoding creates a binary feature transformation.
    value: OneHotEncoder
  - description: Target encoding for categorical data.
    value: CatTargetEncoder
  - description: Tf-Idf stands for, term-frequency times inverse document-frequency. This is a common term weighting scheme for identifying information from documents.
    value: TfIdf
  - description: Weight of Evidence encoding is a technique used to encode categorical variables. It uses the natural log of the P(1)/P(0) to create weights.
    value: WoETargetEncoder
  - description: Label encoder converts labels/categorical variables in a numerical form.
    value: LabelEncoder
  - description: Word embedding helps represents words or phrases as a vector, or a series of numbers.
    value: WordEmbedding
  - description: Naive Bayes is a classified that is used for classification of discrete features that are categorically distributed.
    value: NaiveBayes
  - description: Count Vectorizer converts a collection of text documents to a matrix of token counts.
    value: CountVectorizer
  - description: Hashing One Hot Encoder can turn categorical variables into a limited number of new features. This is often used for high-cardinality categorical features.
    value: HashOneHotEncoder
