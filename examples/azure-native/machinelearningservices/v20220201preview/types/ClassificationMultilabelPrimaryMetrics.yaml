enum:
  - description: |-
      AUC is the Area under the curve.
      This metric represents arithmetic mean of the score for each class,
      weighted by the number of true instances in each class.
    value: AUCWeighted
  - description: Accuracy is the ratio of predictions that exactly match the true class labels.
    value: Accuracy
  - description: |-
      Normalized macro recall is recall macro-averaged and normalized, so that random
      performance has a score of 0, and perfect performance has a score of 1.
    value: NormMacroRecall
  - description: |-
      The arithmetic mean of the average precision score for each class, weighted by
      the number of true instances in each class.
    value: AveragePrecisionScoreWeighted
  - description: The arithmetic mean of precision for each class, weighted by number of true instances in each class.
    value: PrecisionScoreWeighted
  - description: Intersection Over Union. Intersection of predictions divided by union of predictions.
    value: IOU
