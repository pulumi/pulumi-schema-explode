  - description: |-
      Classification in machine learning and statistics is a supervised learning approach in which
      the computer program learns from the data given to it and make new observations or classifications.
    value: Classification
  - description: Regression means to predict the value using the input data. Regression models are used to predict a continuous value.
    value: Regression
  - description: |-
      Forecasting is a special kind of regression task that deals with time-series data and creates forecasting model
      that can be used to predict the near future values based on the inputs.
    value: Forecasting
  - description: |-
      Image Classification. Multi-class image classification is used when an image is classified with only a single label
      from a set of classes - e.g. each image is classified as either an image of a 'cat' or a 'dog' or a 'duck'.
    value: ImageClassification
  - description: |-
      Image Classification Multilabel. Multi-label image classification is used when an image could have one or more labels
      from a set of labels - e.g. an image could be labeled with both 'cat' and 'dog'.
    value: ImageClassificationMultilabel
  - description: |-
      Image Object Detection. Object detection is used to identify objects in an image and locate each object with a
      bounding box e.g. locate all dogs and cats in an image and draw a bounding box around each.
    value: ImageObjectDetection
  - description: |-
      Image Instance Segmentation. Instance segmentation is used to identify objects in an image at the pixel level,
      drawing a polygon around each object in the image.
    value: ImageInstanceSegmentation
  - description: |-
      Text classification (also known as text tagging or text categorization) is the process of sorting texts into categories.
      Categories are mutually exclusive.
    value: TextClassification
  - description: Multilabel classification task assigns each sample to a group (zero or more) of target labels.
    value: TextClassificationMultilabel
  - description: |-
      Text Named Entity Recognition a.k.a. TextNER.
      Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the ability to take free-form text and identify the occurrences of entities such as people, locations, organizations, and more.
    value: TextNER
