description: Enum for all Regression models supported by AutoML.
type: string
enum:
  - description: Elastic net is a popular type of regularized linear regression that combines two popular penalties, specifically the L1 and L2 penalty functions.
    value: ElasticNet
  - description: The technique of transiting week learners into a strong learner is called Boosting. The gradient boosting algorithm process works on this theory of execution.
    value: GradientBoosting
  - description: |-
      Decision Trees are a non-parametric supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks.
      The goal is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.
    value: DecisionTree
  - description: |-
      K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses 'feature similarity' to predict the values of new datapoints
      which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based on how closely it matches the points in the training set.
    value: KNN
  - description: Lasso model fit with Least Angle Regression a.k.a. Lars. It is a Linear Model trained with an L1 prior as regularizer.
    value: LassoLars
  - description: |-
      SGD: Stochastic gradient descent is an optimization algorithm often used in machine learning applications
      to find the model parameters that correspond to the best fit between predicted and actual outputs.
      It's an inexact but powerful technique.
    value: SGD
  - description: |-
      Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm.
      The "forest" it builds, is an ensemble of decision trees, usually trained with the “bagging” method.
      The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.
    value: RandomForest
  - description: Extreme Trees is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that combines the predictions from many decision trees. It is related to the widely used random forest algorithm.
    value: ExtremeRandomTrees
  - description: LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms.
    value: LightGBM
  - description: "XGBoostRegressor: Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor is a supervised machine learning model using ensemble of base learners."
    value: XGBoostRegressor
