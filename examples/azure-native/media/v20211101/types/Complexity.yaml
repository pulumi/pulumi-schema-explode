description: "Allows you to configure the encoder settings to control the balance between speed and quality. Example: set Complexity as Speed for faster encoding but less compression efficiency."
type: string
enum:
  - description: Configures the encoder to use settings optimized for faster encoding. Quality is sacrificed to decrease encoding time.
    value: Speed
  - description: Configures the encoder to use settings that achieve a balance between speed and quality.
    value: Balanced
  - description: Configures the encoder to use settings optimized to produce higher quality output at the expense of slower overall encode time.
    value: Quality
