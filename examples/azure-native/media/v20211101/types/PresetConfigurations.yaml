description: An object of optional configuration settings for encoder.
properties:
  complexity:
    oneOf:
      - type: string
      - $ref: "#/types/azure-native:media/v20211101:Complexity"
    description: "Allows you to configure the encoder settings to control the balance between speed and quality. Example: set Complexity as Speed for faster encoding but less compression efficiency."
  interleaveOutput:
    oneOf:
      - type: string
      - $ref: "#/types/azure-native:media/v20211101:InterleaveOutput"
    description: "Sets the interleave mode of the output to control how audio and video are stored in the container format. Example: set InterleavedOutput as NonInterleavedOutput to produce audio-only and video-only outputs in separate MP4 files."
  keyFrameIntervalInSeconds:
    type: number
    description: "The key frame interval in seconds. Example: set KeyFrameIntervalInSeconds as 2 to reduce the playback buffering for some players."
  maxBitrateBps:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum bitrate in bits per second (threshold for the top video layer). Example: set MaxBitrateBps as 6000000 to avoid producing very high bitrate outputs for contents with high complexity."
  maxHeight:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum height of output video layers. Example: set MaxHeight as 720 to produce output layers up to 720P even if the input is 4K."
  maxLayers:
    type: integer
    description: "The maximum number of output video layers. Example: set MaxLayers as 4 to make sure at most 4 output layers are produced to control the overall cost of the encoding job."
  minBitrateBps:
    type: integer
    description: "The minimum bitrate in bits per second (threshold for the bottom video layer). Example: set MinBitrateBps as 200000 to have a bottom layer that covers users with low network bandwidth."
  minHeight:
    type: integer
    description: "The minimum height of output video layers. Example: set MinHeight as 360 to avoid output layers of smaller resolutions like 180P."
