This mode provides the ability to choose between the following settings: 1) Analyze - For detection only.This mode generates a metadata JSON file marking appearances of faces throughout the video.Where possible, appearances of the same person are assigned the same ID. 2) Combined - Additionally redacts(blurs) detected faces. 3) Redact - This enables a 2-pass process, allowing for selective redaction of a subset of detected faces.It takes in the metadata file from a prior analyze pass, along with the source video, and a user-selected subset of IDs that require redaction.
