Live event type. When encodingType is set to None, the service simply passes through the incoming video and audio layer(s) to the output. When encodingType is set to Standard or Premium1080p, a live encoder transcodes the incoming stream into multiple bitrates or layers. See https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2095101 for more information. This property cannot be modified after the live event is created.
