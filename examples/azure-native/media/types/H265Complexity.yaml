description: Tells the encoder how to choose its encoding settings.  Quality will provide for a higher compression ratio but at a higher cost and longer compute time.  Speed will produce a relatively larger file but is faster and more economical. The default value is Balanced.
type: string
enum:
  - description: Tells the encoder to use settings that are optimized for faster encoding. Quality is sacrificed to decrease encoding time.
    value: Speed
  - description: Tells the encoder to use settings that achieve a balance between speed and quality.
    value: Balanced
  - description: Tells the encoder to use settings that are optimized to produce higher quality output at the expense of slower overall encode time.
    value: Quality
