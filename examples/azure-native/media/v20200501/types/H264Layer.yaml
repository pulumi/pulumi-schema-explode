$token: azure-native:media/v20200501:H264Layer
description: Describes the settings to be used when encoding the input video into a desired output bitrate layer with the H.264 video codec.
properties:
  adaptiveBFrame:
    type: boolean
    description: Whether or not adaptive B-frames are to be used when encoding this layer. If not specified, the encoder will turn it on whenever the video profile permits its use.
  bFrames:
    type: integer
    description: The number of B-frames to be used when encoding this layer.  If not specified, the encoder chooses an appropriate number based on the video profile and level.
  bitrate:
    type: integer
    description: The average bitrate in bits per second at which to encode the input video when generating this layer. This is a required field.
  bufferWindow:
    type: string
    description: The VBV buffer window length. The value should be in ISO 8601 format. The value should be in the range [0.1-100] seconds. The default is 5 seconds (for example, PT5S).
  entropyMode:
    oneOf:
      - type: string
      - $ref: "#/types/azure-native:media/v20200501:EntropyMode"
    description: The entropy mode to be used for this layer. If not specified, the encoder chooses the mode that is appropriate for the profile and level.
  frameRate:
    type: string
    description: The frame rate (in frames per second) at which to encode this layer. The value can be in the form of M/N where M and N are integers (For example, 30000/1001), or in the form of a number (For example, 30, or 29.97). The encoder enforces constraints on allowed frame rates based on the profile and level. If it is not specified, the encoder will use the same frame rate as the input video.
  height:
    type: string
    description: The height of the output video for this layer. The value can be absolute (in pixels) or relative (in percentage). For example 50% means the output video has half as many pixels in height as the input.
  label:
    type: string
    description: The alphanumeric label for this layer, which can be used in multiplexing different video and audio layers, or in naming the output file.
  level:
    type: string
    description: We currently support Level up to 6.2. The value can be Auto, or a number that matches the H.264 profile. If not specified, the default is Auto, which lets the encoder choose the Level that is appropriate for this layer.
  maxBitrate:
    type: integer
    description: The maximum bitrate (in bits per second), at which the VBV buffer should be assumed to refill. If not specified, defaults to the same value as bitrate.
  odataType:
    type: string
    description: |-
      The discriminator for derived types.
      Expected value is '#Microsoft.Media.H264Layer'.
    const: "#Microsoft.Media.H264Layer"
  profile:
    oneOf:
      - type: string
      - $ref: "#/types/azure-native:media/v20200501:H264VideoProfile"
    description: We currently support Baseline, Main, High, High422, High444. Default is Auto.
  referenceFrames:
    type: integer
    description: The number of reference frames to be used when encoding this layer. If not specified, the encoder determines an appropriate number based on the encoder complexity setting.
  slices:
    type: integer
    description: The number of slices to be used when encoding this layer. If not specified, default is zero, which means that encoder will use a single slice for each frame.
  width:
    type: string
    description: The width of the output video for this layer. The value can be absolute (in pixels) or relative (in percentage). For example 50% means the output video has half as many pixels in width as the input.
