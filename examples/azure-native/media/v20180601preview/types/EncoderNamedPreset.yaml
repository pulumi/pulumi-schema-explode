description: The built-in preset to be used for encoding videos.
type: string
enum:
  - description: Produces a set of GOP aligned MP4 files with H.264 video and stereo AAC audio. Auto-generates a bitrate ladder based on the input resolution and bitrate. The auto-generated preset will never exceed the input resolution and bitrate. For example, if the input is 720p at 3 Mbps, output will remain 720p at best, and will start at rates lower than 3 Mbps. The output will have video and audio in separate MP4 files, which is optimal for adaptive streaming.
