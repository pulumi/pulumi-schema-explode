      type: string
    description: The list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool creation will fail.

    items:
      type: object
      $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20190401:ApplicationPackageReferenceResponse"
    description: Changes to application package references affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do not affect compute nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or reimaged. There is a maximum of 10 application package references on any given pool.
  autoScaleRun:
    type: object
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20190401:AutoScaleRunResponse"
    description: This property is set only if the pool automatically scales, i.e. autoScaleSettings are used.
  certificates:
    type: array
    items:
      type: object
      $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20190401:CertificateReferenceResponse"
    description: For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.

    type: string
    description: The ETag of the resource, used for concurrency statements.
  interNodeCommunication:
    type: string
    description: This imposes restrictions on which nodes can be assigned to the pool. Enabling this value can reduce the chance of the requested number of nodes to be allocated in the pool. If not specified, this value defaults to 'Disabled'.
  lastModified:
    type: string
    description: This is the last time at which the pool level data, such as the targetDedicatedNodes or autoScaleSettings, changed. It does not factor in node-level changes such as a compute node changing state.
  maxTasksPerNode:
    type: integer
    description: The default value is 1. The maximum value is the smaller of 4 times the number of cores of the vmSize of the pool or 256.

    items:
      type: object
      $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20190401:MetadataItemResponse"

  scaleSettings:
    type: object
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20190401:ScaleSettingsResponse"
    description: Defines the desired size of the pool. This can either be 'fixedScale' where the requested targetDedicatedNodes is specified, or 'autoScale' which defines a formula which is periodically reevaluated. If this property is not specified, the pool will have a fixed scale with 0 targetDedicatedNodes.
  startTask:
    type: object
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20190401:StartTaskResponse"
    description: In an PATCH (update) operation, this property can be set to an empty object to remove the start task from the pool.
  taskSchedulingPolicy:
    type: object
    $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20190401:TaskSchedulingPolicyResponse"
