  properties:
    allocationState:
      type: string
      description: |-
        Values are:

         Steady - The pool is not resizing. There are no changes to the number of nodes in the pool in progress. A pool enters this state when it is created and when no operations are being performed on the pool to change the number of dedicated nodes.
         Resizing - The pool is resizing; that is, compute nodes are being added to or removed from the pool.
         Stopping - The pool was resizing, but the user has requested that the resize be stopped, but the stop request has not yet been completed.

    applicationLicenses:
      type: array
      items:
        type: string
      description: The list of application licenses must be a subset of available Batch service application licenses. If a license is requested which is not supported, pool creation will fail.

      items:
        type: object
        $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20170901:ApplicationPackageReferenceResponse"
      description: Changes to application packages affect all new compute nodes joining the pool, but do not affect compute nodes that are already in the pool until they are rebooted or reimaged.
    autoScaleRun:
      type: object
      $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20170901:AutoScaleRunResponse"
      description: This property is set only if the pool automatically scales, i.e. autoScaleSettings are used.

      items:
        type: object
        $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20170901:CertificateReferenceResponse"
      description: For Windows compute nodes, the Batch service installs the certificates to the specified certificate store and location. For Linux compute nodes, the certificates are stored in a directory inside the task working directory and an environment variable AZ_BATCH_CERTIFICATES_DIR is supplied to the task to query for this location. For certificates with visibility of 'remoteUser', a 'certs' directory is created in the user's home directory (e.g., /home/{user-name}/certs) and certificates are placed in that directory.

    id:
      type: string
      description: The ID of the resource.
    interNodeCommunication:
      type: string
      description: This imposes restrictions on which nodes can be assigned to the pool. Enabling this value can reduce the chance of the requested number of nodes to be allocated in the pool. If not specified, this value defaults to 'Disabled'.
    lastModified:
      type: string
      description: This is the last time at which the pool level data, such as the targetDedicatedNodes or autoScaleSettings, changed. It does not factor in node-level changes such as a compute node changing state.

      description: Describes either the current operation (if the pool AllocationState is Resizing) or the previously completed operation (if the AllocationState is Steady).
    scaleSettings:
      type: object
      $ref: "#/types/azure-native:batch/v20170901:ScaleSettingsResponse"
      description: Defines the desired size of the pool. This can either be 'fixedScale' where the requested targetDedicatedNodes is specified, or 'autoScale' which defines a formula which is periodically reevaluated. If this property is not specified, the pool will have a fixed scale with 0 targetDedicatedNodes.

For information about available VM sizes for pools using images from the Virtual Machines Marketplace (pools created with virtualMachineConfiguration) see Sizes for Virtual Machines (Linux) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-sizes/) or Sizes for Virtual Machines (Windows) (https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-sizes/). Batch supports all Azure VM sizes except STANDARD_A0 and those with premium storage (STANDARD_GS, STANDARD_DS, and STANDARD_DSV2 series).
