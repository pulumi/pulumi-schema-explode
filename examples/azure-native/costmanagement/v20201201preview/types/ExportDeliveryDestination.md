This represents the blob storage account location where exports of costs will be delivered. There are two ways to configure the destination. The approach recommended for most customers is to specify the resourceId of the storage account. This requires a one-time registration of the account's subscription with the Microsoft.CostManagementExports resource provider in order to give Azure Cost Management services access to the storage. When creating an export in the Azure portal this registration is performed automatically but API users may need to register the subscription explicitly (for more information see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services ). Another way to configure the destination is available ONLY to Partners with a Microsoft Partner Agreement plan who are global admins of their billing account. These Partners, instead of specifying the resourceId of a storage account, can specify the storage account name along with a SAS token for the account. This allows exports of costs to a storage account in any tenant. The SAS token should be created for the blob service with Service/Container/Object resource types and with Read/Write/Delete/List/Add/Create permissions (for more information see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/export-cost-data-storage-account-sas-key ).
